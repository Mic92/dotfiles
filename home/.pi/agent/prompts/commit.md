description: Commit staged changes (or all if nothing staged)
---

Commit the changes using this style:

- when writing commit messages focus on the WHY rather than the WHAT.
- imperative mood
- concise, no conventional commit prefixes
- optionally use a context prefix when it adds clarity (e.g., "docs:", "cli:")
- paragraphs instead of bullet points

If nothing is staged, stage all changes first.
